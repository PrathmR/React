Introduction
Welcome to a new project! In this project, we will attempt to build the video
 interface of tiktok and clone it with React. Our objective in this lab is:

Create same video interface as tiktok
Use real videos
The videos should scroll and snap properly
Fetch video information from an API URL.
The UI should be built with React
In this classroom, we will build the whole interface for tiktok making 
sure of all the things listed above. On the right, you can see how the final app 
would look and feel like. 
From the next lab onwards, we will start building this from scratch. Letâ€™s go!



**Challenge1: Creating the project structure**
For the player tiktok clone, we will use the following components overall:

Video.jsx - This will contain our video element and other 2 components below
FooterLeft - This consists of information you see about the tiktok 
video (title, description, music, etc.)
FooterRight - This consists of like, share, and comment buttons. 
For this lab, we will focus exclusively on the UI of these buttons.
Challenge Requirements
Let us build the Video.jsx component in this lab. 
Read the requirements below carefully in order to pass this challenge:

You should create a new file called Video.jsx (already created for you)
Inside this file, make sure you have a div with class video as the root element.
Inside div.video, make sure you have a video element with class player and loop attribute set as well.
Your video element should have the src of props.url where url is passed as the component prop.

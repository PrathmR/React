Introduction
Welcome to a new project! In this project, we will attempt to build the video
 interface of tiktok and clone it with React. Our objective in this lab is:

Create same video interface as tiktok
Use real videos
The videos should scroll and snap properly
Fetch video information from an API URL.
The UI should be built with React
In this classroom, we will build the whole interface for tiktok making 
sure of all the things listed above. On the right, you can see how the final app 
would look and feel like. 
From the next lab onwards, we will start building this from scratch. Letâ€™s go!

Introduction to Project
Welcome to another React practice project. In this project you have to create 
a Tours app in React, which is a simple UI app fetching data 
over network and then displaying it on the screen.

**Challeng1: Fetching Tours Data
This project relies on data from a remote API, 
so let us fetch that JSON data before doing anything else. 
In React, there are much better ways of handling data fetching 
which comes baked in with caching and revalidation of data, 
but because this is a beginner level classroom project, we want to learn how to do it using 
just fetch API provided by the browser.

This is how a basic fetch request can be performed in a React component:

const MyComponent = () => {
   useEffect(() => {
      fetch('<YOUR URL>').then(data => {
         // work with your data
      })
   }, [])
}
Let us break this down:

We use a useEffect hook, because we want to run this query only once.
How do we make sure we run this query only once? We make sure by passing an 
empty array [] as the second argument in the useEffect hook. Remember that useEffect hook
 will be called every time any dependency within that dependency array gets changed 
 (this is a simplified statement, but would work for now). Therefore, by passing an 
 empty array, we want useEffect to never be called again.
Because all useEffects are automatically called once the component is mounted, this 
will run exactly one time per component mount.
Challenge Instructions
To pass this lab, take care of the following things:

Create a state variable tours (done for you)
Use useEffect hook and call the fetchTours() function.
Inside fetchTours , fetch the contents of the API URL: https://course-api.com/react-tours-project
Once fetched, set the data to tours state variable.
This should now automatically display some data in UI which should pass your tests.

**Challenge1: Creating birthday view container**

Welcome to a new React project! In this project, 
we will use React to simply render a list of data items which will be birthdays of a few people.. 
This will be rendered from a static data source, 
and should help you understand how to import and use/clear data inside a state.

Let's start by creating some static views. 
One thing you can remember as a tip, you can always create static data holders first, 
and then populate them with dynamic data later on.

This is a very clean approach to build dynamic components as it allows 
you to make the component ready before you fill it dynamically with data.

Challenge Instructions
Inside your App.jsx file, create the following HTML hierarchy:
main > section.container > h3 + List
Hint: The above abbreviation means that your structure should look like the following:
<main>
	<section className="container">
    	<h3></h3>
        <List />
    </section>
</main>
Your h3 should contain the text:
0 birthdays today
Your <List /> component should be the List.jsx component which is imported at the top.

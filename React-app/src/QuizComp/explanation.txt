**Challenge1 : Setting the first question dynamically**

Welcome to a new React project. In this project we will create a quiz app completely in React.

Let us go through the project boilerplate in this lab. You can see we start with a raw structure, take your time and browse the App.jsx file to understand how it works currently.

It is mostly static data with a few questions, so let us start adding dynamic functionality to it.

Challenge Instructions
To pass this lab, you will need to change the text “This is where the question text should go” to the text of the first question.
HINT: You can access the first question using questions[0]


**Challenge2: Setting the first question answers dynamically**

Alright. Now that we have setup our question dynamically using questions[0], let us add the correct options for this question too.

You should now replace the Answer 1 and so on with correct options for the first question only. Your final output should have the first question, and the correct options with it. That is:

Q: What is the capital of France

New York
London
Paris
Dublin
Challenge Instructions
To pass this lab, you will need to change the text “This is where the question text should go” to the text of the first question using questions[0].questionText (already done)
You should map on questions[0].answerOptions and display the text (using .answerText in separate buttons)
HINT: You can access the first question using questions[0]

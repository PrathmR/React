**Setting the first question dynamically**
Welcome to a new React project. In this project we will create a quiz app completely in React.

Let us go through the project boilerplate in this lab. You can see we start with a raw structure, take your time and browse the App.jsx file to understand how it works currently.

It is mostly static data with a few questions, so let us start adding dynamic functionality to it.

Challenge Instructions
To pass this lab, you will need to change the text “This is where the question text should go” to the text of the first question.
HINT: You can access the first question using questions[0]

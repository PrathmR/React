Introduction to project
Welcome to a new React project! In this project, we will use React to create a 
full single page application for a Restaurant menu with category based filters.


**Challenge1:Getting basic UI Ready**
Welcome to the second lab. In this lab let us go ahead and create the UI for App.jsx file. 
To pass this lab, make sure of the following things:

Your App.jsx structure should look like this
<main>
	<section className="menu section">
		<div className="title">
			<h2>our menu</h2>
			<div className="underline"></div>
		</div>
		<Categories />
		<Menu />
	</section>
</main>

**Challenge2:Passing data to Menu page
Alright! Take a look inside data.js file. 
It is a JSON file containing the data for your page. 
In this lab, let us go ahead and first of all pass our data to the Menu 
component present inside App.jsx which you created in the last lab. 
To pass this lab, make sure of the following things:

Inside Menu.jsx make sure you receive a prop called items. 
This passed prop will be an array of objects (from data.js file)
Inside App.jsx pass the data imported from the data.js to Menu.jsx file. 
You can do it directly for now, but later we will create a state variable using useState 
to store the menu items, because we might need to change it depending on the category.
Inside Menu.jsx, make sure your UI looks as following:
<div className="section-center">
	for each item in passed item props:
	 <article className="menu-item">
		<img src={IMAGE OF ITEM} alt={TITLE OF ITEM} className="photo" />
		<div className="item-info">
			<header>
				<h4>{TITLE OF ITEM}</h4>
				<h4 className="price">${PRICE OF ITEM}</h4>
			</header>
			<p className="item-text">{DESC OF ITEM}</p>
		</div>
	</article>
</div>

**Challenge3:Creating Categories
This will be a quick lab. In this lab, let us go ahead and populate our Categories.jsx file. 
This component will be responsible for displaying categories at the top 
to toggle different items on the menu. To pass this challenge:

Make sure your returned UI from Categories.jsx looks like this:
<div className="btn-container">
	<button className="filter-btn">All</button>
	<button className="filter-btn">Breakfast</button>
	<button className="filter-btn">Shakes</button>
</div>
